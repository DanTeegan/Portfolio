# Portfolio Project

In this project i aim to carry out the following:

- Using Python and flask create, a portfolio application
- Create a series of unit tests for the application
- Using Terraform (IaC) to orchestrate the creation of infrastructure on AWS.
- Using Jenkins to create a pipeline to automate the integration of code, perform the unit tests and deploy the application into a live production environment (Given that the builds pass)
- Deploying the application onto the VPC previously created using IaC
